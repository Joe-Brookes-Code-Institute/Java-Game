Core gameplay feel

When shot the game slows down slightly to let the player know they’ve take a hit, this should feel somewhat bad for the player as their character no longer controls smoothly 

Ammo

Wire Frames

It resembles some classic shooter arcade machines so it’s longer than it is wider.
This should work with a number of devices.

Features Left to Implement
Many features didn’t make the cut or were unfinished.
Two enemy types one finished but left on the cutting room floor due to implementation problems
He’s still in the game but his functions have been switched off, can you spot him
A scrolling background was planned, the bombs would flash and when shot were meant to blow up, the flashing animation was finished but code issues meant it had to be left out.
Stages would have seen enemy types change and ammo and speed change.
A intro screen was finished, implement and then lost and couldn’t be recovered in time for deployment.
Saving scores was planned and cut due to time.
